## Overview

**Advent of Code** is an annual event that presents programmers with daily puzzles throughout December.
Each puzzle encourages creative problem-solving and coding skills, providing a fun way to sharpen your programming knowledge during the holiday season.

This repository showcases my approaches and solutions to the puzzles I worked on.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
advent_of_code_2025/
│
├── day1_part1.py  # Solution for Day 1, Part 1
├── day1_part2.py  # Solution for Day 1, Part 2
├── day2_part1.py  # Solution for Day 2, Part 1
├── day2_part2.py  # Solution for Day 2, Part 2
│
└── README.md        # This README file
```

Each Python file corresponds to a specific day's challenge with both parts labeled appropriately.

## Requirements

To run the solutions, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you need to install Python, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, you can execute the desired Python file. For example, to run the first part of Day 1:

```bash
python day1_part1.py input_file
```

You can similarly run the second part with:

```bash
python day1_part2.py input_file
```
